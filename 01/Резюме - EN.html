      I have been engaged in Google advertising since 2016, during this time I
      was able to work with about 30 campaigns, in the direction search engine
      and trade Google advertising. Also in 2018, he began to provide services
      in parallel in the direction of targeted (Facebook / Instagram)
      advertising and Google Analytics. As a result, I came to the fact that I
      was able to provide a full range of campaigns on the Internet, backing
      it up with well-tuned analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When working with campaigns, it is important for me to understand that
      my work brings results (sales / leads). Therefore, on start, I always
      start with deep analytics and site audit. I create packages of edits for
      layout designers, if the site needs it. I know from experience that many
      factors influence the result, so my task is pull up all available
      factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I began to notice that not all Google businesses give the
      desired result, sometimes it happens for various reasons, but sometimes
      the problem is in Google advertising itself as a traffic channel. In
      this case, I I offer clients targeted ads to check if the problem is
      with traffic from Google ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every business I work with is individual. I don't have a
      one-size-fits-all recipe. So I I work on the principle of trial and
      analysis. With some businesses, you can immediately find the right
      working principle. With some, I will say as it is, it does not always
      work out. You need to understand that advertising is only an engine, but
      also it is very important in which car this engine is installed and how
      the driver drives this car.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2016 to the present day, I only work with campaigns in a remote
      format. I am open to communication in all possible messengers and chats,
      both in correspondence and in calls. But apart from that, if the
      campaign is necessary, I can come any day, for a live meeting or do it
      on a regular basis, for example, once a week, if there is a real need.
